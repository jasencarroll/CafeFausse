# Cafe Fausse

This repository holds the software artifacts for Cafe Fausse, a Quantic Univesity project as part
the MSSE.

## Backend

The backend is hosted via Flask. It uses packages such as `Flask-CORS` and `WTForms`.

## Frontend

The frontend is hosted via a React app, and the React Router DOM, using Vite. The front end is further
bootstrapped with `Bootstrap`, `React Bootstrap` for styling and `Axious` for a front-end RESTful API.

## Running Development

- Run your Flask app with `python app.py` to serve the built React app.
- Run `npm start` in reactjsx-client for development with hot reloading.
- Open `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser.
